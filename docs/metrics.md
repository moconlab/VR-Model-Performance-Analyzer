# VR Model Performance Metrics

## Geometry
- Triangle Count
- Object Count
- Instancing

## Materials
- Transparent vs Opaque
- Texture resolution
- Texture memory footprint

## Draw Calls
- Estimated draw calls
- Impact on VR FPS

## LOD
- Number of LODs
- Triangle reduction ratio

## Scene Tiling
- Large object scenes recommend tiling
- Helps with culling and batching

## VR Performance
- Predicted FPS (heuristic + ML)
- Runtime FPS (GPU profiling)
- Device-specific targets: Standalone VR / PC VR
